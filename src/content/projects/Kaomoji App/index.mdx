## Interactive Demo
I created this tool to generate fun emotes for text messaging! Currently, there are collections of different moods and emotes on dedicated kaomoji websites and apps. I wanted a way to create my own emotes with flexibility and ease, while having a chance to experiment with vanilla JS. Have fun with this tool!  



## Kaomoji’s are hard to sort through..

## So what?

Well, there are plenty of *other* Emoji generators out there!

From uncanny bitmoji’s of ourselves, to remixing existing emojis, and of course we’ve got AI-generated emojis now (see: [Genmoji released on iOS 18](https://emojipedia.org/genmoji)), I think it’s time to popularize text-emotes again with our own flair! 

## Design Process

![Whimsical is my go-to wireframing tool, super quick to spit out a conceptual design.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e26c6993-f13d-46ac-b40d-8e5a18f23a2d/17a51a61-bf91-4f1e-a9bf-57f21f7b2f64/image.png)

Whimsical is my go-to wireframing tool, super quick to spit out a conceptual design.

From this, I was able to break down the necessary components I needed to build:

 **Key Components**

1. A **data structure** for storing and managing kaomoji components.
2. A **dynamic text display** that updates based on user inputs.
3. **Tabbed UI** for selecting different face elements.

## 1. Data Structure

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e26c6993-f13d-46ac-b40d-8e5a18f23a2d/72880c4c-2a4f-41f4-84c2-2b84a9224455/image.png)

- Using an array allowed me to place face parts (which could be composed of multiple characters to represent one part) in a consistent order.
- Face parts are categorized into arrays of strings as well. Each category has their own logic for being placed in the template.
- There are two slots next to each cheek to store an arm/gesture facing towards the left or right. In the example above, the emoji is facing left, so only the left arms [0] and [6] are used.

### **Special Case:** ᐛ

Most parts are separate characters, but because ᐛ combines (eye and mouth) parts it required its own category for “single characters that contain both mouth and eyes”. So when ᐛ is selected, it will clear out the eyes [3] and [5] first, and then populate the mouth slot [4]. Otherwise you end up with something like:

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e26c6993-f13d-46ac-b40d-8e5a18f23a2d/346eed47-917f-4a3e-bce5-dac392e304e6/image.png)

4 eyeballs! Which looks a bit odd. 

### **Limitations**

- There are a few expressions that fall outside of this scope.. For example, if the Kaomoji shows someone laying down, or not facing forward.. ∠( ᐛ 」∠)_  it would break the original structure. but since these positions are uncommon, I omitted it for this prototype. In the future, it would make sense to have different face templates for different body positions. Otherwise, if I use the same structure for dynamic positions, it would get confusing to track each limb
- Later, I want to expand on this to add objects and accessories. Like flipping tables over or holding objects! I could generalize the “ARM” indexes to be useful for additives like these.

 

## 2. Dynamic Text Display

Kaomoji uses a text area that updates anytime a user wants to change the face.

### Special Case:

An interesting problem I encountered was sometimes the characters would “shift” based on specific unicodes being adjacent to each other.. 

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e26c6993-f13d-46ac-b40d-8e5a18f23a2d/d5f6e3ba-3221-4a13-85fc-13fea8b60cf5/image.png)

This seemed true for hiragana and katakana characters next to this ☉ `solar sun` unicode symbol. I did not find other stark differences like this with other combinations. But, If there was a katakana or hiragana character, the next character will shift slightly. 

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e26c6993-f13d-46ac-b40d-8e5a18f23a2d/3a260356-5f17-467e-be8c-6297106a406e/image.png)

[ why does this happen? ]

here’s some approaches considered → 

1. Using an invisible spacer character after any katakana / hiragana letters. 
2. Using a normal space between all characters - └ [  ◕ ヮ ◕  ] ┘ this happens with the randomizer! (arbitrary)
3. Doing NOTHING - since it is a minor issue. when you paste the kaomoji outside the app, it remains the same. 
4. Changing the user’s view (fonts) or informing the user about the wonky view 

I decided to add an invisible spacer character to the definition of any characters that caused this issue. 

## 3. Tabbed UI

- One of the initial challenges I faced was implementing tab navigation without relying on pre- made components or the state management conveniences that React offers. I wanted to build it from scratch using vanilla JS, which let me experiment with different ways to manage state and update the UI manually. To be honest, this is still a weak area for me. In my future projects, I want to learn more standard methods to achieve this. But here’s what I ended up doing!
- I decided to dynamically generate the buttons on page load instead of hard-coding them in HTML, this would give me more flexibility and scalability to add more face parts in an array as I kept building. Each button was linked to a specific category of face parts stored in an array, with the button’s label reflecting the array’s value.
- Later, I needed visual feedback when a button or tab was actively selected. Also, if the user wanted to randomize the expression, I needed to ensure that the button highlights were reset appropriately. So, I created some standalone functions to clear all hidden/active css class attributes associated with buttons and tabs.. While this worked, it was a bit unconventional

## Next Goals

- Adding save / clipboard history
- Organizing CSS styling better (tailwind config)
- Improve edge case handling

That’s all! I’ll continue to update this post with rambles about development. Thanks for reading!
