> Simpler is better. Simplest, is what you already do!


`knowledge management systems` is a rabbit hole I’ve faced in many forms, mostly in forms of procrastination. Though I’ve been using Obsidian for at least a year, my notes are a *mess* to look at, my process is changing all the time, so I don’t have many strict principles to organize them. 

But hey, do I use it everyday? Yes! Start simple, fall into patterns over time, and tweak settings as you go. **The tools that you *actually use* are the ones that matter. *That* is your second brain. The process and methods you follow don’t matter as much, so long as you use the tool consistently.**

There are *so* many guides on how to effectively use Obsidian as a second brain, a common place notebook, or a digital garden. Tweaking your vault has the same appeal as customizing an operating system.. It is pretty fun! So, how can you sift through the noise and find a process that works for you? 

## First, what tools are you already using?

- Before even considering Obsidian, What are you *already* using? to take notes, to plan your day, to jot down ideas.. Do you use a notebook? Notion? Calendar? Sticky notes? What do you tend to write down? What do you forget or lose track of?
- If you mostly use physical notes, then what benefit could you have from switching to digital? What issues have you had with digital tools before?
- If you already use a digital tool, what kind of new features are you looking for? and is it worth it to switch to a new tool entirely?

Andy Bell says it well, “[Just use fucking paper, man](https://andy-bell.co.uk/just-fucking-use-paper-man/)” If you really want to get things done, work with the tools you’re already using, and if those suck, go back to using paper. 

Examples:

- “*I lose my physical notes all the time..” →* Have you tried using a commonplace notebook? The idea is to have a single notebook to hold all your thoughts, lists, and plans. It could help with keeping track of things! You can also pair it with having a smaller notebook you keep on the go, then add it to your main notebook later.

- “*I already have a notebook, but I never look at it” →* Have you tried pairing physical notes with digital reminders to remember to review them? Even keeping physical bookmarks/tabs in your notebook might help. Digital reminders can be as simple as a re-occurring calendar event. If this is for studying, try using spaced-repetition. If you already have a digital notebook you don’t look at, try to pin it on your desktop or browser. Maybe your browser automatically opens it as a homepage, or it opens up when your PC starts.

- *“I have multiple apps that work for me.. but it would be nice to have it all in one!”* → Honestly, it’s unlikely that a single app can meet all your needs. Maybe for cohesion, you can try to automate certain processes with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) or [ITTT](https://ifttt.com/). These are apps that can connect with other apps and perform actions based on triggers. Sometimes, It’s better to have multiple apps that are good at specific things, rather than one app that’s only half-good at everything.

## You only need the basics of Obsidian to get started

Ok, you’ve determined that it’s time to try something new! Let’s dive into the basics and nothing more.

Assuming you’ve got [Obsidian installed and have perused the docs](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian).. 

1. Your first vault will NOT be perfect. In fact, name this vault something like “Experimental-Notes” or “Testing”, and let yourself go wild for a week or two. 
2. Markdown is your friend! Every note in Obsidian is a markdown file. It is very text-heavy. 
3. Hyperlinking `[[ name of note ]]`  is the primary means of travel between notes. 
    - By typing [[ ]] you can create a link to a note via its title (existing or not)
    - By adding `!` in front of a hyperlink, you can embed a preview of the note
    - If this is unnatural to you, maybe give [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas) a try! You can drag and edit notes on a “canvas” and make connections there.
4. Take notes as you usually would, but keep the above concepts in mind and experiment with how you connect different files together. Here’s some ideas on types of notes you could take: 
    1. Study → reference, flashcards, summaries
    2. Journal → daily, trackers, media reviews, opinions
    3. Creative writing → narratives, outlines, ideas, drafts
5. Adding `---` to the top of a note will show metadata, where you can add tags and properties. 
    - This can be helpful if you want to categorize your notes to search for later.
    - If you want to get extra fancy, the [dataview plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=dataview) can query and display your notes based on these properties.
6. Explore the core plugins before adding community ones. (As there are many community plugins that work well with core ones.) Here are some core plugins:
    - Daily Notes: If you prefer having chronological notes.
    - Random Notes: If you want a way to jump to a random note as a way to facilitate revisiting old notes.
    - Unique Note Creator: If you want to explore note-taking methods like Zettelkasten and slip-boxes by ensuring every note is uniquely named.

Without going into detail about specific vault structures, plugins, or note taking methods, this is all you need to get started in building up your new vault! Use resources like the [community forum](https://obsidian.md/community) and the [docs](https://help.obsidian.md/Home) to learn more or get feedback!

Your notes will be messy at first, but if you keep up with it, your vault can become truly customized to you!
